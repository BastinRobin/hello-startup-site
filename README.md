Hello, Startup Website
==================

This is the website for [Hello, Startup: A Programmer's Guide to Building 
Products, Technologies, and Teams](http://www.hello-startup.net), an 
O'Reilly book by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).

The website includes information about the book, a variety of resources you
can use to build a startup, and a mobile app that packages these resources using
PhoneGap.

Architecture
==================

* [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/): used to assemble static HTML out of layouts, 
  includes, and data files. 
* [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/): used to concatenate and minify CSS and
  JavaScript.
* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/): used to package up the static HTML as 
  iOS and Android apps.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): for hosting the website.

Running the website
==================

1. Install [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/)
2. Install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
3. `npm install`
4. `grunt`
5. http://localhost:4000

The `grunt` command runs `grunt watch`, which will watch for changes in the 
background and recompile everything as necessary. Jekyll is a bit slow, so it
can take ~5 seconds for your changes to be visible.

Running the mobile app
==================

1. Install [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/)
2. Install the [PhoneGap Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com/) on your 
   computer and the mobile app for your phone.
3. Run `grunt` as explained in the "Running the website" instructions. This will
   assemble all of the HTML we need.
4. Add a new project to the PhoneGap Developer App by adding the `mobile` 
   folder (which has `config.xml`).
5. At the bottom of the PhoneGap Developer App, it should tell you that the
   project is running and the URL. Open this URL on your mobile phone.
6. If you want to build the app for real, use 
   [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com).

Making PhoneGap and Jekyll work together
==================

Both PhoneGap and Jekyll require a specific folder structure, and those are not
mutually compatible. To make this all work using the same content in the same 
repo, I've used a bit of a hack with symlinks:

1. PhoneGap's `config.xml` and `index.html` are in the `mobile` folder. 
2. Everything else is in the normal Jekyll locations (e.g. `_includes`, `_layouts`, 
   `javascripts`, `stylesheets`). All of these files get compiled into the normal
   Jekyll output folder (`_site`). 
3. I've added symlinks from the `mobile/www` folder to `_site`. Therefore, if
   you point PhoneGap at the `mobile` folder, it will see the folder structure
   it expects.
4. Since `_site` is normally generated by the Jekyll build process, you don't
   usually check it in. However, I had to in this case, or the symlinks won't
   work, which causes an error when GitHub Pages tries to build the site. 
   Therefore, I've checked in a few placeholder files, which will be overwritten
   as soon as the build runs.

The Startup Resources
==================

The Startup Resources pages are completely generated from 
[yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) data files in the `_data` folder (see the 
[Jekyll Data Files](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) documentation for 
more info) and the screenshots for them are in `images/resources`.
