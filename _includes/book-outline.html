      <h2>The Book</h2>
      <h3>
        <em>{{ site.short_title }}</em> is a practical, actionable, how-to guide to startups. 
        The book consists of three parts: Products, Technologies, and Teams. Below is the
        list of chapters in each part, and under each chapter, an outline of the concrete 
        techniques, tools, and skills you will learn from reading it. Although at its core, 
        this is a book for programmers, by programmers, only Part II, Technologies, is 
        significantly technical. Parts I and III should be accessible to technical and 
        non-technical audiences alike.

              opportunity to build products that touch millions of lives; what is a 
              startup; why you should work at a startup; why you shouldn't work at a 
              startup.

              how to design a user interface that doesn't make users feel stupid; why you should 
              try to build products that are great in just a few areas rather than good at everything;
              how to define a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).
