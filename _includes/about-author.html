      <p>
        I got my BS and Masters in Computer Science at 
        Cornell University, started my career at several big companies 
        (Cisco Systems, Thomson Financial, Cornell University), and then made the jump into the startup world 
        (LinkedIn, TripAdvisor). Along the way, I got the chance to work on

        I wish I had a book like <em>{{ site.short_title }}</em> back when I was in college. By the time I 
        graduated, I had a BS, a Masters, a bunch of internship 
        experiences&mdash;and absolutely no idea what I was doing.
        What technologies should I learn and use? Why should I spend time writing automated tests?                 
        How do I build a user interface that doesn't look terrible?  
        How do I get people to use my product?
        How do I negotiate a job offer? Should I negotiate for 
        more salary or more equity? What is equity, anyway? And most 
        importantly, should I work at a large company or join a startup?                 
        <br/> 
        <br/>
        I learned the answers to these questions, and many others, the hard way&mdash;through trial
        and error. I also learned that thousands of other developers before me went through the same 
        inefficient trial and error process. It doesn't have to be this way. While there are a small
        number of lessons that you can only learn by making your own mistakes, my hope is that you can
        learn everything else by studying the successes, failures, and stories in <em>{{ site.short_title }}</em>.
