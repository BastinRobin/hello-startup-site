      How much are my stock options worth? Is it worth taking a lower salary for
      them? Use this calculator to answer this question. Note: this is a 
      <em>very</em> rough estimate. It doesn't take into account taxes, 
      dilution, and various investor tricks such as preference and 
      participation. See the "Getting a Job at a Startup" chapter in 
      <em>Hello, Startup</em> for more info.
